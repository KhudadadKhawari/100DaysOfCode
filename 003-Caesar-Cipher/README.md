# Day 3: August 11

**Today's Progress**: Today I solved some Coding Challenges on SoloLearn App. Also watched some Tutorials online. I also worked on this Caesar Cipher program. if You need a description about Caesar Cipher Click [HERE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)
<br>
 
**Thoughts** I'm having a hard time both preparing for exam and completing coding challenges. Anyway I will never give up.
