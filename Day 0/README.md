# Day 0: August 8, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've reviewed basic syntax in python. practiced with functional programming and Object oriented programming in python.
<br>
while working with functions I've worked on Hangman Game. you can find more about this game [here on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) .

<br> 
**Thoughts** Python is an interesting language for me. I love to master this programming Language. still have some difficulties with Functional programming in Python.
