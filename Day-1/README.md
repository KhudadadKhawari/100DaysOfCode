# Day 1: August 9, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I Solved some Coding challenges in SoloLearn App with python. Also, I watched some tutorials on udemy. Here I am uploading the two small projects of my today work which are Tip Calculator and Love Calculator.
<br>
 
**Thoughts** Since I have worked too much with Problem-solving today wasn't a big deal for me. I will try to work on some bigger projects.
